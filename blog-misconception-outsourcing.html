          <h4>Common Misconceptions About Outsourcing</h4>
          <small>March 28,2019</small>
          <p>For any organization to be successful, their business relationships play an extremely crucial role, and trusting third party partners with parts of their business is now a common practice in most companies, and the trend has only increased over the years. However, as a business owner, making the decision to outsource a part or all of your business is certainly not something easy. As soon as you make up your mind to proceed with outsourcing, you will encounter the challenges of comprehending the risks associated with the outsourcing process, which also includes the processes of identifying, cross-checking, and choosing the right service provider and managing the whole transition.</p>

          <p>Establishing a path or approach to successful outsourcing involves dealing with the ambiguities, avoiding the perils, and understanding and ignoring the misconceptions about outsourcing. Following are some of the common misconceptions about outsourcing that many business leaders have:</p>

          <h5>Only Large Companies Can Outsource</h5>
              <p>One of the biggest misconceptions or mistakes about outsourcing is that only big companies can involve in the same. This thought is quite common among startup companies and SMEs as they think that only large enterprises have the ability and resources to take all or part of their operations offshore.</p>

              <p>Yes, outsourcing firms are naturally enticed by bigger companies as their clients, but they are definitely welcoming to smaller companies as well. As a matter of fact, SMEs happen to be the biggest customers for BPOs in different countries. A huge percentage of SMEs still continue to outsource many of their operations, especially IT services, as they happen to be in constant need to find skilled labor as well as reduce their operational costs.</p>
              <p>
                Therefore, regardless of the size of your business and the industry you operate in, you can choose to outsource any part of your operation to a skilled third-party service provider. Whether you wish to outsource only a specific project, relegate a few small tasks, or completely outsource a huge part of your operations offshore, you will be able to receive customized services to meet your varied goals. If yours is an SME, with the limited resources and time you have, the benefits you can achieve from outsourcing, in addition to it being a cost-effective solution, are many: better customer service, ability to provide new capabilities to your clients or customers, reduced delivery costs, improved quality, reduced transaction time, and more
              </p>
                <h5>Outsourced Work Lacks Quality</h5>
                <p>There are business owners and executives who believe that outsourced work will lack quality just because the services are offered at lower costs. And not to forget, people also believe that employees of their outsourcing partner are often less skilled and/or experienced that those in the US or wherever the company is from. This is such a misconception, because all outsourcing service providers, belonging to different parts of the world, have in-house experts who are capable of offering the professional help you need for your job.</p>
                <p>If you didnâ€™t know already, one undeniable fact is that most companies choose outsourcing as an effective approach for successful business operations is because they get access to proper intellectual capital, which includes a diverse set of resources and skills. This helps businesses visualize things from a new perspective and implement new strategies that can get them the positive results they need. Therefore, understand that outsourced work is cost-effective because overhead and labor costs are significantly lower in some offshore outsourcing countries when compared to having an in-house team for the same, and certainly not because the work you receive is of low quality.</p>
                <h5>Outsourcing is Suitable Only for Tech Companies</h5>
                <p>Yes, IT is perhaps the most outsourced business operation. This is because these operations are not highly impacted by cultural differences, distance, or other such factors that are thought to affect outsourcing, However, this doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that outsourcing is suitable only for tech companies. Surveys conducted by different organizations have revealed that business functions such as human resources, finance, procurement, real estate, and legal will see a steady increase in outsourcing in the near future. And when it comes to industries, healthcare, retail financial services, and of course, software and tech happen to have the most number of companies that prefer outsourcing.</p>
                <h5>Outsourcing is Expensive and Time Consuming</h5>
                <p>If you think that having an in-house team for whatever functions you are thinking about outsourcing will be cheaper, understand that it is just a false assumption. When you hire full-time employees, in addition to having the necessary infrastructure, the other costs you incur include the basic salary for your employees plus their benefits, such as sick pays, holidays, vacations, etc., all of which together will cost you more than you expect.</p>
                <p>With outsourcing, you get to eliminate all of these administrative and operational costs and the time required for setting up everything, and use them to focus on developing new products or services, expanding your business, or your core business activities. In addition, with their readily available resources and infrastructure, the outsourcing partner you choose will be able to set everything up within a short span of time, start work almost immediately, and also deliver instant results. This, again, saves you a lot of time, which is highly crucial for any business.</p>
                <h5>Client Has Less to No Control on the Process</h5>
                <p>So, how does outsourcing work? Basically, a company partners with a third-party service provider to take care of certain business operations or functions. For instance, you may want the payroll function in your company to be outsourced, and when you do that, people who work on the same, from the outsourced company, will work only on the task at hand. They donâ€™t have a say on any other matter pertinent to your business, and you have complete control on everything. As the client, you will be providing the service provider with your specific demands and how you want things done, which will be followed to a T by your outsourcing partner.</p>
                <h5>Outsourcing Could Compromise Companyâ€™s Privacy and Security</h5>
                <p>When you do your research on outsourcing, you are likely to come across different online sources that discuss about privacy breach in outsourcing. Hence, privacy and security continue to be a major concern for individuals and businesses looking to outsource their work. This is a concern for not just the client company, but also the outsourcing partner, as both parties are on edge when dealing with confidential information. Therefore, outsourcing service providers have the responsibility to prove themselves to be trustworthy in order to be successful in the industry and develop long-lasting relationships with their clients.</p>
                <p>Since data/companyâ€™s privacy and security has been a long-lasting concern when it comes to outsourcing, all reliable outsourcing service providers have a proper data privacy policy in place, which will/should be frequently updated to meet the changing demands of clients based on current economic trends. It doesnâ€™t end there, outsourcing partners, with the aim of maintaining the privacy and security of their clients, further use various other security provisions, such as secure remote access using VPN, secure log-in to the premises, penetration testing, access to authorized personnel only, non-disclosure agreements, secure network firewalls, and more to prevent security breaches. Therefore, you can trust your companyâ€™s data privacy and security to a reliable outsourcing partner from a low-risk outsourcing location.</p>
                <h5>Outsourcing is a Short-Term Option</h5>
                <p>If you think outsourcing is just a short-term option, then you are most likely looking only at those outsourced projects that donâ€™t add much value to your business. Similar to any other business organization, outsourcing companies also need and value long-term clients, which, of course, is their source of long-term earnings and cash flow. Moreover, outsourcing firms today have started offering strategic services as well, such as enterprise resource planning, and more, which means they are in for the long run, and establishing long-term contracts with them will only improve their ability to learn about and understand your business structure better, which in turn enables them to offer the right solutions to meet your needs.</p>
                <h5>Outsourcing Sales Can Damage Company Branding</h5>
                <p>While most business owners and executives choose to believe that only they have the capability to sell their products or services better, it isnâ€™t true in all instances. For the product or service to sustain in the current highly competitive market, you need a good marketing mix, which outsourcing partners specialize in offering with their extended knowledge base, skills, and experience.</p>
                <p>The time your in-house sales and marketing team spends researching the market and conducting surveys to come up with an effective marketing plan will be completely eliminated when you use the expertise of an offshore outsourced team, which already has acquired the necessary knowledge from their previous clients and experiences. Hence, outsourcing your sales can also be very helpful for your companyâ€™s success.</p>
