          <h4>Common Misconceptions About Outsourcing</h4>
          <small>April 08,2019</small>
          <p>Starting and running your own business and being your own boss can be an invigorating experience. Regardless of the reason you chose this path, there will be a time when you realize that things aren’t really going as planned, even though it is your dream come true. There could be several reasons for this, but one thing you will know at the time is that things need to change. There will be certain things that you will want to do differently.</p>

          <p>In the present dynamic world of business, there is constant pressure on businesses when it comes to succeeding in the extremely competitive market. As a result, only those companies that know how to bring down their operational costs and make the most efficient use of available resources while maintaining the standard and quality of the products and/or services they offer will be able to succeed.</p>

          <p>One of the most effective ways for businesses to maximize their efficiency and improve productivity is by outsourcing one or more of their business functions. There are also companies that choose to outsource entire departments to field experts in other parts of the world. But, before you decide to go for outsourcing, you need to determine if your business is ready for the same right now. This is because, not all companies have the ability to manage the various aspects involved in the process, and understanding beforehand that your company is not ready for outsourcing yet will save you a lot of time and money you would otherwise spend going forward with the process.</p>
          <h5>The Big Decision</h5>
          <p>Why is outsourcing the right solution for some businesses and not so much for others? One of the biggest influencers of this decision happens to be the culture at your business. Some businesses really embrace the whole concept of outsourcing while others hesitate to invest in the same. Also, there are cases where a company could be too efficient, or even too small at the time, to attain the results they desire from outsourcing. Even worse, some companies enter outsourcing but fail to learn and plan to manage it.</p>
          <p>So, if you are considering outsourcing for your business, here are some signs to look for to know if our business is ready to outsource and prevent any mishap:</p>
          <h5>There is No Time</h5>
          <p>Whether you own a startup, an SME, or a large enterprise, running a business takes time, period. From maintaining your website to writing and answering emails to bookkeeping, and more, there are several tasks that need to be completed on a daily basis just to keep everything in check.</p>
          <p>When you spend all the time you have working on the basic tasks, you will have very little to no time to spend on the future plans for your business, which can result in you and your business becoming stationary and lagging. When you start realizing that your business hasn’t seen much growth over the past few months, it is about time you rethink your strategies. So, when you reach a stage where you can no longer manage everything, you may have to start thinking about outsourcing.</p>
          <h5>Your Business is Growing</h5>
          <p>For any entrepreneur, watching their business grow is one of the most satisfying things to experience, and with so many new and innovative marketing techniques, businesses now have the ability to grow and gain popularity at a much rapid pace. In order to make your company succeed in the long run, you need to have a proper long-term growth strategy. To effectively manage your growing business, one strategy that can be of immense help to you is outsourcing. To start with, you can outsource some of your business processes, especially those that are highly time-consuming, so you can get back some time to focus working on your core business processes.</p>
          <h5>You are Turning Down New Work and Opportunities</h5>
          <p>Developing your business would be your top priority as an entrepreneur. But, many business owners often fail to achieve this because of their lack of ability to determine the resources required for the same. So, how would you know if you are at this stage already? Well, if you have had inquiries from potential clients that would otherwise have been significantly beneficial for your business, but you had to turn them down due to lack of sufficient resources, then yes, you are there.</p>
          <p>In this case, it is definitely time to start outsourcing at least some of your business processes; it could be your customer service, marketing, back office functions, or any other low-value tasks that you think use too much of your resources. Outsourcing some of your business functions to offshore service providers will help streamline your business and enhance your productivity.</p>
          <h5>Customer Satisfaction Has Declined</h5>
          <p>Your customers are your pillars and they declare your business’ success and failure. For your company to thrive, you need to make sure that your customers remain happy and satisfied. However, when you don’t have proper resources, or already have a lot on the plate, customer satisfaction is most likely to decline. This is one instance where outsourcing can come to your rescue. Outsourcing your customer service operations to a third party will ensure that no calls or emails from customers go unanswered, and that customer service standards are always met. In addition, you also get to save money and attain multi-channel and 24x7 support.</p>
          <h5>Your Business is Undergoing a Major Transition</h5>
          <p>A major transition for any business would be expanding to the international market. While this is a huge step and definitely shows the success of your company, you should be ready to meet the more demanding expectations of the global audience. With your global expansion, you will now start to receive inquiries from people in different countries and time zones, expecting immediate response. Using the services of an offshore support team, who work in shifts to accommodate the varying time zones, enables you to be available for 24x7 communication, without having to worry about losing potential customers or clients.</p>
          <p>If you see one or more of these signs, then your business is ready to outsource. Just don’t wait until things go overboard and your business starts to suffer.</p>
